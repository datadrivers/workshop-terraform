# Best Practices

1. terraform modules, incl. root modules, hold following files
    * versions.tf -  contains the terraform block with the attributes required_version and required_providers
    * main.tf - contains the module code
    * variables.tf - contains all module variables
    * outputs.tf - contains all output objects
    * README.md - Contains at least a short description of the module, examples of usage and the description of the module generated by terraform-docs
2. Terraform root modules hold following files
    * backend.tf - contains the terraform backend configuration  (could be generated by terragrunt)
    * provider.tf - contains the configurations of the individual providers (could be generated by terragrunt)
    * versions.tf -  contains the terraform block with the attributes required_version and required_providers
    * main.tf - contains the module code
    * variables.tf - contains all module variables
    * outputs.tf - contains all output objects
3. Terraform resource name are written in `snake_case`
4. Variables are always defined with `type` and `description`
5. Outputs are always defined with `value` and `description`
6. Terraform version and plugin versions are pinned to specific version and specifically updated
